<h2>EECS 345: Programming Language Concepts</h2>
<h2>Interpreter Project, Part 5</h2>
<h3>Due Monday, April 29</h3>

<p><em>For this and all Interpreter Project's, you are strongly encouraged, but not required, to work in a team of two.  
You will be building off of the interpreter you wrote for part 4.  As a result, it is expected that you keep the same teams
that you used for part 4.  If you need to change your team, please speak to the course instructor.</em></p>

<p>In this homework, you will expand on the interpreter of part 4 by adding objects (instances of classes), and the ability
to throw and catch exceptions. </p>

<p><strong>Details from pervious parts that must be maintained:</strong><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>For pairs:</em>  all variables may now store either integers or objects.  Likewise, functions may now return integers or
objects (or they may not return a value).  Functions must be able to modify class and instance fields as well as call other 
functions.  All functions are call-by-value (with object parameters, if you pass the object itself and you are using boxes for your environment, 
you will get the same behavior as with normal Java).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>For teams:</em>  all variables may now store integers, booleans, or objects.  Likewkse, functions may now return integers, booleans,
or objects (or they may not return a value).  Functions must be able to modify clas and instance fields as well as call other functions.
Function parameters can be either call-by-value or call-by-reference.  The assignment operator returns a value.  Function overloading is permitted.</p>

<p>An example program is as follows:
</p><pre>class A {
  var x = 6;
  var y = 7;

  prod() {
    return this.x * this.y;
  }

  set2(a, b) {
    x = a;
    y = b;
  }
}

class B extends A {
  set1(a) {
    set2(a, a);
  }

  static main () {
    var b = new B();
    b.set1(10);
    return b.prod();
  }
}
</pre>

Your interpreter should now take two parameters, a <em>file</em> and a <em>classname</em>.  For example,
<tt>(interpret "MyProgram.j" "B")</tt>, where <em>file</em> is the name of the file to be interpreted, and <em>classname</em>
is the name of the class whose main method you are to run.  The function should call <tt>parser</tt> on the file
<em>file</em>, and then lookup <tt>(string-&gt;symbol <em>classname</em>)</tt> in the environment to get the desired
class, and then lookup the <tt>main</tt> method of this class.
The final value returned by your interpreter should be whatever is returned by <tt>main</tt>.<p></p>

<h4>Details</h4>

<p>
</p><ol><li>Note that we now allow the object type in our language.  So, objects can be assigned to variables,
passed as parameters, and returned from functions.</li>
<li>All mathematical and comparison operators should only be implemented for integers (or booleans).</li>
<li>The only operator that will work on objects is the <tt>dot</tt> operator.</li>
<li>The <tt>new</tt> operator will return an object of the desired class.</li>
<li>The <tt>new</tt> operator can only be used in expressions, not as the start of a statement.</li>
<li>Variables and methods can now be static (class) or non-static (instance).</li>
<li>The <tt>main</tt> method should be static.</li>
<li>The language supports use of <tt>this</tt> and <tt>super</tt> object references.</li>
<li>The top level of the program is only class definitions.</li>
<li>Each class definition consists of assignment statements and method definitions.</li>
<li>Nested uses of the <tt>dot</tt> operator are allowed.</li>
<li>The language supports <tt>try</tt>, <tt>catch</tt>, and <tt>finally</tt> blocks, and the <tt>throw</tt> statement.</li></ol><p></p>


<h4>Parser Constructs</h4>

<p>
</p><pre>class A {              =&gt;   (class A () <em>body</em>)
  <em>body</em>

class B extends A {    =&gt;   (class B (extends A)  <em>body</em>)
  <em>body</em>

static x = 5;          =&gt;   (static-= x 5)

static main() {        =&gt;   (static-function main () <em>body</em>)
  <em>body</em>

new A()                =&gt;   (new A)

a.x                    =&gt;   (dot a x)

new A().f(3,5)         =&gt;   (funcall (dot (new A) f) 3 5)

throw e;               =&gt;   (throw e)

try {                  =&gt;   (try <em>body</em> (catch (e) <em>body</em>) (finally <em>body</em>))
  <em>body</em>
}
catch (e) {
  <em>body</em>
}
finally {
  <em>body</em>
}
</pre>
Note that either the finally or the catch block may be empty:
<pre>try {                 =&gt;  (try <em>body</em> (catch (e) <em>body</em>) ())
  <em>body</em>
}
catch (e) {
  body
}
</pre>
As there are no types, only one catch statement per try block is allowed.
<p></p>

<h4>Basic Task</h4>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Write an interpreter that correctly handles objects and classes.  You should be able to create
objects (using a generic constructor), set values, call methods, and use values <tt>this</tt> and <tt>super</tt>.
Solo programmers do not have
to support user defined constructors.  Step 1 correctness will be the majority of your interpreter grade.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Add the ability to throw and catch exceptions.  You will need to add a <tt>throw</tt> continuation to
your interpret routines.</p>

<h4>For Teams:</h4>

<p>Add user-defined constructors.  The constructor should be a method with the same name as the class, and it should be called by the
new operator.  You should support constructor overloading, and you should support the class hierarchy by having the constructors
for a class call the constructor for the super class using the <tt>super</tt> function call (or automatically if no <tt>super()</tt> is 
present).  If no constructor has been created, allow for a generic constructor.  As a hint, make the constructor list be a separate environment
of the class from the method environment.  That way constructors will not be inherited.</p>
