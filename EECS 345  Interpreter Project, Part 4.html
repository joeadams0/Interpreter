<h2>EECS 345: Programming Language Concepts</h2>
<h2>Interpreter Project, Part 4</h2>
<h3>Due Wednesday, April 17</h3>

<p><em>For this and all Interpreter Project's, you are strongly encouraged, but not required, to work in a team of two.  
You will be building off of the interpreter you wrote for part 1.  As a result, it is expected that you keep the same teams
that you used for part 3.  If you need to change your team, please speak to the course instructor.</em></p>

<p>In this homework, you will expand on the interpreter of part 3 adding class definitions. <em>Note that we will not be adding
objects in this part of the interpreter.</em>
We still assume all variables store integers (for the individuals working solo) and integers and boolean (for those
working in teams).  Likewise, all functions will only return integers (for the individuals working solo) and integers
and boolean (for those working in teams).  For teams, we will also still allow functions to be both call-by-value
and call-by-reference.</p>

<p>Here is an example of a program of two classes, using only static fields and methods:
</p><pre>class Rectangle {
  static var width = 10;
  static var height = 12;

  static area() {
    var a = width * height;
    return a;
  }

  static setSize(x, y) {
    width = x;
    height = y;
  }
}

class Square extends Rectangle {
  static setSize(x) {
    super.setSize(x, x);
  }

  static main() {
    setSize(20);
    return area();
  }
}
</pre>

Your interpreter should now take two parameters, a <em>file</em> and a <em>classname</em>.  For example,
<tt>(interpret "MyProgram.j" "Square")</tt>, where <em>file</em> is the name of the file to be interpreted, and <em>classname</em>
is the name of the class whose main method you are to run.  The function should call <tt>parser</tt> on the file
<em>file</em>, and then lookup <tt>(string-&gt;symbol <em>classname</em>)</tt> in the environment to get the desired
class, and then lookup the <tt>main</tt> method of this class.
The final value returned by your interpreter should be whatever is returned by <tt>main</tt>.<p></p>

<h4>For Teams</h4>

<p>For those working in a team, you must also allow for method/function overloading.  Since we are only checking types dynamically,
an overloaded function must have a different number of parameters.</p>

<h4>Details</h4>

<p>
</p><li>Variables and methods can now be static (class) or non-static (instance).</li>
<li>The <tt>main</tt> method should be static.</li>
<li>The language supports use of <tt>super</tt>.</li>
<li>The top level of the program is only class definitions.</li>
<li>Each class definition consists of variable declarations and function definitions (just like the top level of part 3 of the interpreter).</li>
<li>Although it will not be useful until the next part of the interpreter, not that nested uses of the <tt>dot</tt> operator will be allowed.</li>


<h4>Parser Constructs</h4>

<pre>class A {              =&gt;   (class A () <em>body</em>)
  <em>body</em>

class B extends A {    =&gt;   (class B (extends A)  <em>body</em>)
  <em>body</em>

static var x = 5;      =&gt;   (static-var x 5)

static main() {        =&gt;   (static-function main () <em>body</em>)
  <em>body</em>

A.x                    =&gt;   (dot A x)

A.f(3,5)               =&gt;   (funcall (dot A f) 3 5)

</pre>

<h4>Basic Task</h4>
<p>Write an interpreter that correctly handles classes, static variables, and static methods.
You should be able to set value for variables, call methods, and use <tt>super</tt>.  </p>

<p>Recall the suggested order from lecture to attack the problem.
</p><ol>
<li>Create helper functions to create a new class and instance (will be needed for part 5) and to access the portions of a class and instance.</li>
<li>Everywhere when interpreting statements and expressions that an environment is passed as a parameter, you also have
to pass parameters for class and instance.</li>
<li>Change the top level interpreter code that you used in part 3 to return a class instead of returning an environment.</li>
<li>Change the top level interpreter code that you wrote for part 3 to expect static and non-static declarations for variables and functions.</li>
<li>Create a new top level for the interpreter that reads
a list of class definitions, and stores each class with its definition in the environment.</li>
<li>Create a function that takes a variable, a class, and an instance, and checks if the variable is in the list of
class or instance variables and returns its value.</li>
<li>Create a function that takes a variable, and environment, a class, and an instance, if the variable is in the environment,
look it up, otherwise look in the class and instance variables. </li>
<li>Create a function that takes the left hand side of a dot expression and returns a (class, instance) pair representing
the class and instance of the left hand side.</li>
<li>Create a function that takes a dot expression, calls the above function to evaluate the left hand side, and looks up the
right hand side in the class/instance variables.</li>
<li>Update your code that interprets a function definition to add a new function to the closure that looks up the function's class
in the environment.</li>
<li>Update the code that evaluates a function call to deal with objects and classes.</li>
<li>Update the code that interprets an assignment statement so that it looks for the variable in the environment, class and instance variables</li>
<li>Create a new <tt>interpret</tt> function.</li>
</ol><p></p>
